## Design

### Colour Scheme

* Linen **(#FFF1E5)** is the main color used as a background of the page. Incorporated from the Financial Times website, this font creates a subtle and calming effect on the eyes of the reader, making it easier to read and process the content on the website. Additionally, the use of Linen as a background color provides a clean and sophisticated look to the overall design, which aligns with the Financial Times' brand image.

### Typography
